### Functions 

add - ads a value to an address
push - adds a value to the next address 
move - moves a value to an address
sub - subtract an address to address
pop - the value of an address wil be saved in the eax register

how would you if 2 addresses are equal subtract and if 0

A Call is just an unconditional GOTO that pushes the next address  on the stack, so  RET instrutions can later pop it off and keep going where the Call left off.
